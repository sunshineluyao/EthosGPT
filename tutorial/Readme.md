### **Comprehensive Step-by-Step Instructions**

This guide explains how to calculate the **Traditional vs. Secular Values** and **Survival vs. Self-Expression Values** indices, assuming a uniform distribution of all possible answers for the standardization process. Each step includes detailed instructions, calculations, and example outputs.

---

### **Step 1: Define Variables**

#### **Traditional vs. Secular Values Questions**
1. **F063**: Importance of God (1–10)
2. **Y003**: Autonomy Index (encoded traits: Independence, Religious Faith, Obedience, etc.)
3. **F120**: Justifiability of Abortion (1–10)
4. **G006**: Pride of Nationality (1–4)
5. **E018**: Respect for Authority (1–3)

#### **Survival vs. Self-Expression Values Questions**
1. **A008**: Feeling of Happiness (1–4)
2. **Y002**: Post-Materialist Index (encoded societal goals)
3. **F118**: Justifiability of Homosexuality (1–10)
4. **E025**: Petition Signing Experience (1–3)
5. **A165**: Trust on People (1–2)

---

### **Step 2: Simulate Uniform Distribution of Responses**

Generate responses that uniformly cover the entire range of possible values for each variable. For example:
- **F063**: Random numbers between 1 and 10.
- **E025**: Random numbers between 1 and 3.

Simulating uniform responses ensures unbiased standardization across all potential answer options.

#### Example Simulated Dataset (First 5 Respondents):
| **Respondent** | **F063** | **Y003** | **F120** | **G006** | **E018** | **A008** | **Y002** | **F118** | **E025** | **A165** |
|----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| 1              | 8.2      | -0.5     | 7.1      | 3.2      | 1.5      | 2.5      | 1.1      | 6.8      | 2.2      | 1.7      |
| 2              | 6.5      | 0.7      | 4.3      | 1.8      | 2.5      | 3.1      | 0.3      | 4.2      | 1.8      | 1.4      |
| 3              | 9.8      | -1.2     | 2.6      | 2.5      | 1.2      | 1.9      | -0.6     | 8.5      | 3.0      | 1.9      |
| 4              | 4.7      | 1.0      | 8.9      | 2.7      | 2.1      | 3.4      | -1.5     | 3.9      | 1.5      | 1.2      |
| 5              | 2.3      | -1.8     | 6.2      | 3.0      | 1.8      | 1.3      | 0.2      | 5.4      | 2.0      | 1.6      |

---

### **Step 3: Standardize Responses**

Standardize responses for each variable using the formula:
\[
z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
\]
Where:
- \(x\) = respondent's answer.
- \(\mu\) = mean of the uniform distribution (midpoint of the range).
- \(\sigma\) = standard deviation of the uniform distribution, calculated as:
\[
\sigma = \frac{\text{max} - \text{min}}{\sqrt{12}}
\]

#### Example for **F063 (Importance of God)**:
- Range: 1–10
- Mean (\(\mu\)): \( \frac{1 + 10}{2} = 5.5 \)
- Std Dev (\(\sigma\)): \( \frac{10 - 1}{\sqrt{12}} \approx 2.598 \)
- Standardized value for \(x = 8.2\): 
\[
z = \frac{8.2 - 5.5}{2.598} \approx 1.039
\]

---

### **Step 4: Calculate Indices Using Factor Loadings**

Apply the factor loadings to the standardized responses to calculate the indices.

#### **Traditional vs. Secular Values Index**:
\[
\text{Index} = (0.70 \cdot F063) + (-0.61 \cdot Y003) + (-0.61 \cdot F120) + (0.60 \cdot G006) + (-0.51 \cdot E018)
\]

#### **Survival vs. Self-Expression Values Index**:
\[
\text{Index} = (0.59 \cdot A008) + (-0.59 \cdot Y002) + (-0.58 \cdot F118) + (0.54 \cdot E025) + (0.44 \cdot A165)
\]

#### Example Calculation for Respondent 1:
- **Traditional Index**:
\[
\text{Index} = (0.70 \cdot 1.039) + (-0.61 \cdot -0.192) + (-0.61 \cdot 0.616) + (0.60 \cdot 0.692) + (-0.51 \cdot -0.423)
\]
\[
\text{Index} \approx 0.727 + 0.117 - 0.376 + 0.415 + 0.216 \approx 1.099
\]

- **Survival Index**:
\[
\text{Index} = (0.59 \cdot -0.385) + (-0.59 \cdot 0.192) + (-0.58 \cdot 0.5) + (0.54 \cdot 0.346) + (0.44 \cdot 0.577)
\]
\[
\text{Index} \approx -0.227 - 0.113 - 0.29 + 0.187 + 0.254 \approx -0.189
\]

### **Step 5: Aggregate Indices at the Country Level**

For real data, compute the **mean index values** for all respondents within each country to create country-level indices.

### **Example Outputs**

#### **Respondent-Level Results**:
| **Respondent** | **Traditional Index** | **Survival Index** |
|----------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| 1              | 1.10                  | -0.19              |
| 2              | 0.85                  | 0.21               |
| 3              | -1.02                 | 0.85               |

#### **Country-Level Results** (Mean Indices):
