![EthosGPT Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x400?text=EthosGPT+Banner)

## **Project Overview**

In a world increasingly shaped by Large Language Models (LLMs), the need for these systems to align with diverse human values has never been greater. **EthosGPT** is an open-source framework designed to map and evaluate LLMs‚Äô positioning across a multidimensional spectrum of human values, fostering cultural inclusivity and ethical adaptability.

## **Key Features**

- **Multidimensional Value Mapping**  
  Visualize LLM performance within a global human values framework.

- **Prompt-Based Evaluation**  
  Assess how well LLMs navigate diverse cultural contexts and ethical scenarios.

- **Comprehensive Case Studies**  
  Explore strengths and limitations through real-world examples.

- **Interactive Tools**  
  Engage with open-source data and visualization modules.

## **Why EthosGPT?**

### üåç **Preserving Cultural Diversity**
LLMs often risk homogenizing values, reflecting dominant cultural biases as observed in research (Tao et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024). EthosGPT emphasizes the need to preserve cultural diversity, akin to the role biodiversity plays in ecological resilience.

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Ethical AI Alignment**
EthosGPT provides critical insights for developing AI systems that are technically robust yet socially and ethically aligned (Kharchenko et al., 2024).

### üîç **Research-Driven Framework**
EthosGPT builds on foundational studies such as CVALUES and CultureLLM to ensure culturally sensitive AI (Xu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024).

## **How It Works**

1. **Prompt Input**  
   EthosGPT uses carefully crafted prompts to probe LLM responses across cultural and ethical contexts.

2. **Response Evaluation**  
   Evaluate the LLM‚Äôs alignment using predefined criteria such as Hofstede‚Äôs cultural dimensions (Kharchenko et al., 2024).

3. **Visualize Results**  
   Generate intuitive visualizations that map LLM performance, highlighting strengths and potential biases.
